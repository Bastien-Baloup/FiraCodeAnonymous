# Fira Code Anonymous

## Combination of Fira Code and Anonymous Pro for italics.

### What is it ?

This is the font setup I use for programming.  
It uses [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) as the default font and [Anonymous Pro bold](https://www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/anonymous-pro) for the italics.  
It also has Fira Code's font ligatures.

This font has been inspired by Kosimst's work on [Firicico](https://github.com/kosimst/Firicico) and [FiraFlott](https://github.com/kosimst/FiraFlott), any information needed on how to use this font can be found in these repositories.  
I used the [Ligaturizer](https://github.com/ToxicFrog/Ligaturizer) script to add the Fira Code ligatures to the Anonymous font
