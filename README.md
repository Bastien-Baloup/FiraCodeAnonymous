# Fira Code Anonymous

## Combination of Fira Code and Anonymous for italics.

### What is it ?

This is the font setup I use for programming.  
It uses Fira Code as the default font and Anonymous bold for the italics.  
It also has Fira Code's font ligatures.

This font has been inspired by Kosimst's work on [Firicico](https://github.com/kosimst/Firicico) and [FiraFlott](https://github.com/kosimst/FiraFlott), any information needed on how to use this font can be found in these repositories.  
I used the [Ligaturizer](https://github.com/ToxicFrog/Ligaturizer) script to add the Fira Code ligatures to the Anonymous font
